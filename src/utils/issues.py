    Apply a series of preprocessing hooks to modify an Issue object.

    This function executes a list of Python code snippets (hooks) that can modify
    the given Issue object and access other relevant milestone information.
    Each hook is executed in the order it appears in the list, with access to
    the current state of the Issue object and milestone data. The current issue
    is available through an `issue` variable passed into the exec() call alongside the hook.

    Args:
        hooks : List[str]
            A list of Python code snippets to be executed as preprocessing hooks.
            Each hook should be a string containing valid Python code.

        issue : Issue
            The Issue object to be processed and potentially modified by the hooks.

        milestone : str
            The name or identifier of the current milestone. This is made available
            to the hooks for potential use in decision-making or modifications.

        startDate : datetime
            The start date of the current milestone. Available to hooks for
            timeline-based logic or modifications.

        endDate : datetime
            The end date of the current milestone. Available to hooks for
            timeline-based logic or modifications.

    Returns:
        The potentially modified Issue object after all hooks have been applied.

    Warnings:
        - Security Risk: This function uses exec() to run the provided hooks.
        Ensure that all hooks come from trusted sources and are properly sanitized
        before execution. Malicious hooks could potentially execute harmful code.
        Please don't use this function unless you know what you're doing.

        - Scope Limitation: Hooks only have access to the variables explicitly
        provided (issue, milestone, startDate, endDate). Any other required data
        should be encapsulated within these variables or the Issue object itself.
