def parse_issue(*, issue_dict: dict) -> Issue:
    """
    Parses a dictionary representing a GitHub Issue fetched through the GraphQL API and returns an Issue object.

    Args:
        issue_dict (dict): The dictionary containing the details of the GitHub issue, typically retrieved from the API.
                           This dictionary is expected to have a specific structure with fields like 'content', 'url',
                           'number', 'title', 'author', 'assignees', 'reactions', 'comments', etc.

    Returns:
        Issue: An instance of the Issue dataclass populated with all the relevant issue details such as title, author,
               created/closed times, assignees, reactions, comments, urgency, difficulty, and modifier values.

    Raises:
        ParsingError: If the structure of the issue_dict does not match the expected format, either due to missing fields
                      or permission errors. Specific errors include:
                      - Missing or incorrect 'content' field.
                      - KeyError for required fields such as 'url', 'number', 'title', 'createdAt', etc.
                      - ValueError if date formatting for 'createdAt' or 'closedAt' fails.
